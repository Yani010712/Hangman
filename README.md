# Hangman

 ### Rules of Hangman, the game works like this:

* A gallows is drawn on a surface, and Player 1 chooses a word that player 2 must guess.
* Empty dashes for each letter in the word are drawn next to the gallows (so a 7-letter word means 7 dashes).
* Each round, player 2 guesses a letter that might belong in the word.
* If the word contains one or more instances of the guessed letter, the dashes corresponding to the guessed letter are replaced with the guessed letter.
* If the word contains no instances of the guessed letter, a limb of a person is drawn on the gallows. This is a "strike", and the letter is recorded as such.
* When a complete stick-figure person is drawn on the gallows, player 2 loses and player 1 wins. If the word is guessed completely before that happens, player 2 wins.
